# Digital Marketing Campaign Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing historical data from digital marketing campaigns, comprising both performance metrics and creative attributes. The goal is to provide insights into the factors that impact campaign performance and predict key outcomes such as engagement and conversion.

## Features
**Data Preprocessing:**

Handling missing data, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical ones.

**Sentiment Analysis:**

Using VADER to analyze text sentiment from campaign content.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

Visualizing correlations between different features like impressions, engagements, and conversion rates.

**Feature Engineering:**

Identifying important features using models like XGBoost and RandomForest.

**Modeling:**

Predicting multiple target variables (e.g., like counts, comment counts) using advanced machine learning algorithms like XGBoost, RandomForest, and Gradient Boosting.

**Error Analysis:**
Evaluation of models based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
